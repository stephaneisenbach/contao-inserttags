# terminal42/contao-inserttags

Adds a back end module to define your custom insert tags. You can limit an insert tag to certain pages,
show it to guests, or only for the logged in frontend users.

## Upgrade from version 1.x

Some options present in version 1.x have been removed. All changes are described below.  

### Removed "timing"

The timing feature has been removed completely, because it would kill HTTP caching. If you need a replacement,
please consider the JavaScript solution with an optional AJAX request(s).

### Removed "useCondition"

### Removed "useCounter"
